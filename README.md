- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kevin-Bonet Kevin J. Bonet Guadalupe
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a job as a software engineer and to work on cool projects. I have many interests, which I will use to populate this github. I like stuff
-  related to AI, Data science, BioMed and Videogames.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make games on Godot. Im also honing my skills in C/C++ and python. I already know the basics since im pursuing a degree in computer engineering, but im working
- on developing a more advanced skillset.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, especially if related to my previously stated interests.
- 📫 How to reach me: email: kevin.bonet@gmail.com
